# Novel coronavirus analysis 
During the quarantine I've decided to delve into the data about the coronavirus. I focused on the Italian and Dutch situation. I actually live in the Netherlands and this work contributed to the Fruitpunch AI challenge 
## Data used
- Italy: https://github.com/ondata/covid19italia
- Netherlands and rest of the World: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
